<p>
As you might have guessed from the domain name; my name is Anton Fagerberg. I am a software developer who currently lives in Lund, Sweden where I study Computer Science and Engineering (M.Sc. in Engineering) at Lund University. My specialization is Software in systems - "to develop large program systems, advanced programming techniques and software engineering solutions".
</p>

<p>
I am currently a part-time employee of Bring Parcels AB where I design and develop business-critical systems for managing everything from linehauls and shipments to orders and parcels.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I do most of my coding with Scala which I really enjoy. In my opinion, it's the perfect blend of object-oriented and functional programming. I do a lot of web development with the Play Framework (Scala) professionally. I have aslo developed with PHP for many years in the past but I try to put that behind me. Beside Scala, I regularly use Java, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, LESS &amp; CSS. I have done some minor work in Haskell, Ruby, C, C++, Objective-C and even a bit of assembly.
</p>

<p>
I do a lot of work with databases which normally is MySQL, mostly beacause of old habits but it is my intention to widen this area in the future. Beside the back-end coding, I do a lot of GUI / design with HTML and LESS/CSS but even though I care very much about design and think I'm decent at it, I do not really enjoy it as much as I used to now that I mostly work with back-end code.

I've created this site as a place for me to write what's on my mind, to show off some projects and talk a bit about myself. Check out the links above and for additional information or check out my <a href="https://github.com/AntonFagerberg">GitHub</a> page to see what I'm currently working on publicly.
