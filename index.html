<p>Welcome to my part of the internet! My name is Anton Fagerberg. I am a software developer living in Lund, Sweden where I'm currently working on my master thesis.</p>

<p>For the last five years, I've been studying Computer Science and Engineering at Lund Univeristy (LTH). My specialisation is software in systems: "to develop large program systems, advanced programming techniques and software engineering solutions".</p>

<p>I've also been working part time during 2014 as a consultant at <a href="http://www.jayway.com">JayWay</a> where I've been doing web programming, mainly with Scala and JavaScript (and some relational databases). Before that, I worked at <a href="http://www.bring.se">Bring</a> where I developed logistics systems in Scala and Play Framework.</p>

<p>My current programming language of choice is <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>. I'm a believer in functional programming and Elixir has a simplicity to it with many concepts which I really like.</p>

<p>Beside Elixir, I've recently been working mainly with Scala which I've enjoyed and JavaScript which I've a little enjoyed less. Over the years, I've been coding some things in Java, C++, Ruby, PHP, Assembler among other things. I've made an Android app and an iPhone app just for fun. Check out my <a href="/projects">projects</a> to see some of the things which I've created.</p>

<p>I like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a> and try to have openness as my general approach in life. I've created this site as a place for me to write what's on my mind, to show off some projects and talk a bit about myself. Check out the links in the menu above and for additional information or check out my <a href="http://www.github.com/antonfagerberg">GitHub page</a> to see what I'm currently working on.</p>

<p>Besides software development, I enjoy tasting new beers, cooking &amp; eating good food, watching cartoons, reading books and I probably follow too many TV-series.</p>
