  title: "Traveling Salesman Problem in C++"
  categories: projects
---

We had a friendly competition at Jayway where I work of who could get the best result in different instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem. I wrote my solver in C++ to refresh my knowledge there an it worked fairly well. I quickly achieved very good results on the smaller instances but had problems dealing with instances with 10,000 nodes.

The code can be modified in different ways depending on the instance and need.
