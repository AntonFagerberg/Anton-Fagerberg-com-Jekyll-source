I made this app, mostly like a proof of concept, since I wanted to try working with Objective-C and how it is like to develop iOS apps in the Apple eco-system. It's a small app which can create and validate Swedish personal identity numbers. I decided not to keep it on the Appstore after my one year "developer license" expired. The development was fairly easy given the small scope of the app and I had no problem with Apples review-process. It had about 50 downloads every week since I released it which was quite a lot more than what I'd expected. I am well aware of that the design is butt ugly!
